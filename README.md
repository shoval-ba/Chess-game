# Chess-game

In the beggining of the course we started to learn HTML, CSS and JS.
After 2 weeks that we leran just HTML and CSS, we started to learn also JS. 
To learn JS, we did Chess-game that written in JS. 
This is my first project that I wrote in JS and I learn a lot from this project. During this project, I learn how to write functions, classes and loops.
