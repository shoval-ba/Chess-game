# Chess-game

In the beginning of the course, we started to learn HTML, CSS and JS. After 2 weeks of HTML and CSS intensive learning, we started also to learn JS. To learn JS, we did a Chess-game that was written in JS. This was my first project that I wrote in JS and I have learned a lot from it. During this project, I learn how to write functions, classes, and loops.
